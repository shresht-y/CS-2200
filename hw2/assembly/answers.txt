Question 1
----------

In order to recreate the jalr instruction, we could simply use basic branch intructions with some extra storing procedures. The psuedocode would 
look something like this:

$temp = lea + 3 offset (to get the address we want to return to)
$ra = temp (sets ra register)
br <target> 

by using these 3 instructions, we are able to store the address we want to return to, and then go to the instruction that we would like. 
We add 3 to the value from lea because we want to continue execution right after the unconditional branch, so that we do not have any infinite
loops. Since jalr does not handle returning to the return address, this would be left to the callee to return.
